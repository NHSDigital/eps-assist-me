# Enabling EPS for your service - NHS England Digital

SCAL notice for suppliers

Please refer to the Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL) as the definitive source of supplier information and guidance for EPS development. You will receive the SCAL when you begin the EPS onboarding process.

The Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) is currently available within primary, secondary and community care settings in England.

Services that would like to enable EPS must ensure they fall into one of the approved care settings, issuing FP10 prescriptions (not FP10HP prescriptions) for dispensing by community, **and** have an approved prescribing system in place.

Examples of primary, secondary and community care settings that can use EPS include:

- GP practices
- child health services
- community physiotherapy, occupational therapy, podiatry, speech and language
- community paediatric clinics, palliative care, mental health services
- district nursing, intermediate care
- specialist nursing services (for example, diabetes, heart failure, incontinence, tissue viability)
- sexual health services
- urgent treatment centres, clinical assessment services
- extended access hubs, GP out of hours
