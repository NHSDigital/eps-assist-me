Question: "Are there any specifications are developers can look at for generating these specifically If a user prescribes say 6 items in a session for a patient- the GP system should separate these as 2 forms with 4 items on one and 2 items on the other. The question here- do both prescription forms have the same Prescription ID or different IDs?"

Answer: "A prescription can have a maximum of 4 line items. Therefore, these will need to be prescribed over a minimum of 2 prescriptions. These prescriptions will have their own unique identifiers."
