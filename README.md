This code is dual licensed under the MIT license and the OGL (Open Government License). Any new work added to this repository must conform to the conditions of these licenses. In particular this means that this project may not depend on GPL-licensed or AGPL-licensed libraries, as these would violate the terms of those libraries' licenses.

## Development

It is recommended that you use visual studio code and a devcontainer as this will install all necessary components and correct versions of tools and languages.  
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers for details on how to set this up on your host machine.  
There is also a workspace file in .vscode that should be opened once you have started the devcontainer. The workspace file can also be opened outside of a devcontainer if you wish.  

All commits must be made using [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

Once the steps at the link above have been completed. Add to your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf as below:

```
use-agent
pinentry-mode loopback
```

and to your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf as below:

```
allow-loopback-pinentry
```

As described here:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/59170001

You will need to create the files, if they do not already exist.
This will ensure that your VSCode bash terminal prompts you for your GPG key password.

You can cache the gpg key passphrase by following instructions at https://superuser.com/questions/624343/keep-gnupg-credentials-cached-for-entire-user-session

### Setup

Ensure you have the following lines in the file .envrc

```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=prescription-dev
```

Once you have saved .envrc, start a new terminal in vscode and run this command to authenticate against AWS

```bash
make aws-configure
```

Put the following values in:

```text
SSO session name (Recommended): sso-session
SSO start URL [None]: <USE VALUE OF SSO START URL FROM AWS LOGIN COMMAND LINE ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS ACCESSED FROM https://myapps.microsoft.com>
SSO region [None]: eu-west-2
SSO registration scopes [sso:account:access]:
```

This will then open a browser window and you should authenticate with your hscic credentials
You should then select the development account and set default region to be eu-west-2.

You will now be able to use AWS and SAM CLI commands to access the dev account. You can also use the AWS extension to view resources.

When the token expires, you may need to reauthorise using `make aws-login`

### CI Setup

The GitHub Actions require a secret to exist on the repo called "SONAR_TOKEN".
This can be obtained from [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/)
as described [here](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/user-guide/user-account/generating-and-using-tokens/).
You will need the "Execute Analysis" permission for the project (NHSDigital_eps-assist-me) in order for the token to work.

### Pre-commit hooks

Some pre-commit hooks are installed as part of the install above, to run basic lint checks and ensure you can't accidentally commit invalid changes.
The pre-commit hook uses python package pre-commit and is configured in the file .pre-commit-config.yaml.
A combination of these checks are also run in CI.

### Make commands

There are `make` commands that are run as part of the CI pipeline and help alias some functionality during development.
